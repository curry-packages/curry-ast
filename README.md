curry-ast
=========

This package contains libraries to deal with the abstract syntax tree of
Curry programs.

The abstract syntax tree contains position information
for the syntactic entities occurring in a Curry program.
Thus, this representation is useful for tools requiring position
information in Curry programs. If this is not required, the
representation provided by the package `abstract-curry` should
be preferred since it is more compact.
